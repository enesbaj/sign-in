- Sign in application
- Usage of Material UI + Tailwind
- Simple authenticazione with mocked API that returns always true (commented there is the version with the error code to test in the Frontend component)
- Non persistent session by default, only managed with the Context API to handle the state
- Rembember me: save in local storage the auth result to keep persistent
- Testing to be completed: Home should not be rendered if not logged in, finish test for the login process
